Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Machine Learning
2. Unsupervised Machine Learning

1. Supervised Machine Learning

Process:
- Input > Output > Model > Prediction

Types of Supervised Machine Learning:
1. Classification
    - Purpose: To predict categorical data
    - Examples: Yes/No, Category
    - Algorithms:
        - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
        - Naive Bayes
        - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
        - Decision Tree
        - Random Forest
2. Regression
    - Purpose: To predict numerical data

Steps to Follow When Creating Machine Learning Algorithms:
1. Data Collection
    - Sources: Kaggle, GitHub
2. Data Preparation and Exploration
3. Model Creation (using ML algorithms)
4. Performance Evaluation Methods
5. Model Improvements

2. Unsupervised Machine Learning

Process:
- Input > Output Produced

Clustering:
- Purpose: Grouping things with similar properties
- Application: Market segmentation

Training Data and Testing Data:

1. Training Data
    - Used to train the model. Data is mostly divided into two parts based on a certain condition.
2. Testing Data
    - Used to test the created model.

Classification – Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm:
    1. Supervised Machine Learning
    2. Applications: Regression and Classification
    3. Principle: Based on the Euclidean distance formula
        - Formula: sqrt((x2 – x1)^2 + (y2 – y1)^2)
